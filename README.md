## Overview üîé

This project implements a simple bank system with classes to represent customers, accounts, transactions, and transaction histories. The main functionality includes creating users, creating accounts, performing deposits and withdrawals, and displaying account statements.

## Classes and Methods üìú

## Functions üîß

### deposit

```python

    customer = filter_customer(id, customers)

    if not customer:
        print("\nCustomer not found!")
        return
    
    amount = float(input("Enter the deposit amount: "))

    if not account:
        return
    
    customer.perform_transaction(account, transaction)
```

- Prompts the user for a customer ID and deposit amount, performs the deposit transaction, and records it.

```python
def withdraw(customers):
    id = input("Enter the customer's id: ")
    customer = filter_customer(id, customers)

    if not customer:

        return
    
    amount = float(input("Enter the withdrawal amount: "))
    transaction = Withdrawal(amount)

    account = retrieve_customer_account(customer)
    if not account:
        return
    
    customer.perform_transaction(account, transaction)
```

- Prompts the user for a customer ID and withdrawal amount, performs the withdrawal transaction, and records it.

### display_statement

```python
def display_statement(customers):
    id = input("Enter the customer's id: ")
    customer = filter_customer(id, customers)

    if not customer:
        print("\nCustomer not found!")
        return
    
    account = retrieve_customer_account(customer)

    statement = ""
    if not transactions:
        statement = "No transactions were made."

    else:
        for transaction in transactions:
            statement += f"\n{transaction['type']}: \n\tR${transaction['amount']:.2f}"

    print(statement)
```

- Prompts the user for a customer ID and displays the account statement

Here's the continuation and completion of the README content:

### create_account

```python
def create_account(account_number, customers, accounts):
    id = input("Enter the customer's id: ")
    customer = filter_customer(id, customers)

    if not customer:
        print("Customer not found! Account creation terminated!")
        return
    
    account = CheckingAccount.new_account(customer=customer, number=account_number)
    accounts.append(account)
    customer.accounts.append(account)

    print("\nAccount successfully created!")
```

- Prompts the user for a customer ID, creates a new checking account for the customer, and adds it to the accounts list.

### create_customer

```python
def create_customer(customers):
    id = input("Enter the id (numbers only): ")
    customer = filter_customer(id, customers)

    if customer:
        print("\nA customer with this id already exists!")
        return
    
    name = input("Enter the full name: ")
    birth_date = input("Enter the birth date: ")
    address = input("Enter the address: ")

    customer = Individual(address, name, birth_date, id)

    customers.append(customer)

    print("\nCustomer successfully created!")
```

- Prompts the user for customer details and creates a new individual customer.

### filter_customer

```python
def filter_customer(id, customers):
    filtered_customers = [customer for customer in customers if customer.id == id]
    return filtered_customers[0] if filtered_customers else None
```

- Filters the list of customers by ID and returns the matching customer.

### retrieve_customer_account

```python
def retrieve_customer_account(customer):
    if not customer.accounts:
        print("\nCustomer has no account!")
        return
    
    return customer.accounts[0]
```

- Retrieves the first account of a given customer.

### list_accounts

```python
def list_accounts(accounts):
    for account in accounts:
        print(str(account))
```

- Lists all accounts and prints their details.

## Menu 

```python
menu = '''

'''
```

- Defines the menu options for the bank system.

## Main

```python
def main():
    customers = []
    accounts = []
    
    while True: 
        option = input(menu)

        if option == "1":
            deposit(customers)

        elif option == "2":
            withdraw(customers)

        elif option == "3":
            display_statement(customers)
        
        elif option == "4":
            break

        elif option == "5":
            create_customer(customers)

        elif option == "6":
            account_number = len(accounts) + 1
            create_account(account_number, customers, accounts)

        elif option == "7":
            list_accounts(accounts)

        else:
            print("This is not a valid option!")

main()
```

- The main function initializes lists of customers and accounts and handles user interactions based on menu choices.
